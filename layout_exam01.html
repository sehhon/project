	<p>메뉴 Nothing too complex, but still pretty cool right? Child’s
			play you say. Ok, well before we get into the part where floats usher
			in a world of bacon-loving unicorns, let’s back up for a second to
			talk about what’s actually happening here. In the web world, our HTML
			is bound by some rules, in particular, the normal flow. In the normal
			flow, each block element (div, p, h1, etc.) stacks on top of each
			other vertically, from the top of the viewport down. Floated elements
			are first laid out according to the normal flow, then taken out of
			the normal flow and sent as far to the right or left (depending on
			which value is applied) of the parent element. In other words, they
			go from stacking on top of each other to sitting next to each other,
			given that there is enough room in the parent element for each
			floated element to sit. This behavior is crucial to remember as you
			build your websites.</p>
	</div>
	<div id = "m3">
		<p>We see floats in the print world every time we pick up a
			magazine article with an image on the left or right with text flowing
			nicely around it. In the world of HTML/CSS, text will wrap around an
			image with the float property applied to it, much like in a magazine
			layout. Images are just one of the many use cases for the float
			property: we can also achieve the popular two-column layout using
			floats. In fact, you can float just about any element in your HTML.
			By learning and understanding float property basics, along with
			position property basics, you will be able to achieve any layout with
			confidence.</p>
	</div>
	<div id = "m4">
		<p>The float property has four values that we can apply to it:
			left, right, inherit, and none. Each value is pretty self
			explanatory. For example, if you assign float: left to an element, it
			will move to the left-most boundary of its parent element. The same
			idea applies if you were to assign float: right; to an element. That
			element would be sent off to the right-most boundary of its parent
			element. The inherit value tells an element to inherit the float
			value of its parent element. The value none is the default value and
			tells an element not to float at all.</p>
	</div>
	<div id = "m5">
	<p>The float property is a valuable and powerful asset to any web
			designer/developer working with HTML and CSS. Tragically, it can also
			cause frustration and confusion if you don’t fully understand how it
			works. Also, in the past, it’s been linked to some pretty nasty
			browser bugs so it's normal to get nervous about using the float
			property in your CSS rule sets. Let’s calm those nerves and ease that
			frustration. I’ll show you exactly what the float property does to
			your elements and how incredibly useful it can be once you master it.
